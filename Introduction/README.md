## Introduction to the System

This project focuses on analyzing and designing the logic for an Online Book Shopping System. The rapid growth of information technology and the internet has significantly transformed the way people purchase goods, including books. Traditional physical bookstores often require considerable time and effort to visit and are limited by location and operating hours, whereas online shopping platforms provide greater flexibility and convenience (Laudon & Traver, 2020).

The proposed system allows users to browse available books, search for specific titles, and complete purchases through a web-based interface. Customers can easily access a wide range of book categories such as academic books, novels, and reference materials without needing to visit a physical store. This convenience and accessibility make online shopping systems more appealing to modern users (Turban et al., 2018).

From the perspective of administrators or store owners, the system supports efficient management of book inventories and customer information, helping to ensure smooth online operations. The primary objective of this system is to simplify the overall book purchasing process for users while maintaining effective backend management, even though certain administrative tasks may involve complexity (Pressman & Maxim, 2020).


## Background and Purpose


The analysis and logical design of an Online Book Shopping System form the primary focus of this project. Rapid advancements in information and communication technology (ICT) and increased internet accessibility have significantly influenced how people purchase goods and services. As a result, online book shopping systems have gained popularity as a convenient and efficient alternative to traditional bookstore shopping, which often requires customers to physically visit stores and is constrained by location and operating hours (Laudon & Traver, 2020).

In the context of the modern education system and the growing online shopping environment, this system is particularly beneficial for students, teachers, and general readers who require timely and efficient access to books. Online shopping platforms allow users to easily obtain academic materials, reference books, and leisure reading resources without unnecessary delays (Turban et al., 2018).

From a system-thinking perspective, the Online Book Shopping System can be decomposed into several interconnected subsystems, including user registration, book search, order processing, payment, and order approval. This modular approach supports a logical system flow, improves usability, and enhances system maintainability while ensuring a positive user experience (Pressman & Maxim, 2020).
