## Introduction to the System

This project focuses on the analysis and logical design of an Online Book Shopping System. The current rapid growth in information and communication technology and internet accessibility has greatly influenced the way in which persons shop for commodities and services. Physical book shopping, where clients physically visit book stores, can sometimes be time-consuming and limited by time and location, thus making online book shopping systems increasingly popular as a convenient and efficient means of buying books.

The Online Book Shopping System is intended to facilitate the browsing, search, and purchasing of books online using the online system. The Online Book Shopping System allows customers to conveniently access a substantial number of books, such as academic texts, novels, and reference publications, without actually visiting the store physically. The primary aim of the Online Book Shopping System is to facilitate the online book shopping process and to enable the efficient management of book and customer details for the online store owners/administrators.


## Background and Purpose

The main concept behind the Online Book Shopping System is the development of a friendly online platform that brings the customer and the book suppliers together in an organised and efficient manner. The customers have the facility to read the details of the book, such as the title, author, cost, and availability, select the desired books to be purchased, and then pay for the goods through the online payment system. There is also the facility for the administrator to maintain the stock and cost of the books and monitor the orders placed by the customers.

With respect to the current education and online shopping environment, this system is very beneficial for students, teachers, and readers as a whole because they all need an efficient and timely means to obtain books. Through system thinking, the Online Book Shopping System can be decomposed into subsystems such as the user registration subsystem, book search subsystem, order subsystem, payment subsystem, and order approval subsystem because it enables a logical flow within the system and is beneficial from a user perspective.
